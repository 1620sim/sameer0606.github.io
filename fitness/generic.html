									<p>Fitting exercise into a busy schedule can be a roadblock to a successful regime. However, people do not need to dedicate large amounts of extra time to exercise to see the benefits.</p>
									<p>Here are some tips for fitting physical activity in a busy schedule:</p>
									<ul><li>Here are some tips for fitting physical activity in a busy schedule:</li>
									<li>People who commute to work by public transport could try getting off their bus or train a few stops early and walking the rest of the way.</li>	
									<li>Consider walking up and down the stairs at your office instead of taking elevators or escalators.</li>
									<li>Try to think about the amount of time spent watching television and avoid binge-watching TV shows. While watching television for extended periods, light exercises, such as stomach crunches or jumping jacks, can help a person include more physical activity in their day.</li>
									<li>If a person enjoys video games, they could consider playing games that encourage physical activity, such as exercise routines on a Nintendo Wii.</li>
									<li>Vigorous housework, gardening, and going up and down the stairs while doing chores also qualify as physical activity and can help people meet the guidelines productively.</li><br>
									<p>People will likely gain the most benefit from exercises they enjoy that fit their lifestyle.</p>
                                    <ui>
									<li>Some of the examples below are the easiest to fit into a daily routine:</li>
									<li>Go for a brisk 30-minute walk five times every week.</li>
									<li>Walk your dog more often or go for walks and jogs with friends.</li>
									<li>Try to add swimming to your weekly routine, even if it is not every day.</li>
									<li>Join some exercise classes that are fun, collaborative, and educational.</li>
									<li>Become a member of a martial arts club. Beginner’s sessions can be gentle and fun.</li><br>
									<p>Exercise is sometimes a gradual learning curve. A person should spread sessions across the week and scale up the intensity slowly.</p>
									<p>It is important for people to ensure they drink plenty of water during and after exercise. Checking with a doctor is a good precaution to take if someone has a health condition or injury that could impact exercise levels, or that exercise could make worse.</p>
									<p>While a combination of aerobic and anaerobic exercise provides the most benefit, any exercise is better than none for people who currently have an inactive lifestyle.</p>

									<h1>Guidelines</h1>
									<p>Current U.S. guidelines recommend that people do one of the following:</p>
                                    <ul>
										<li>at least 150–300 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise a week</li>
										<li>a minimum of 75–150 minutes of vigorous-intensity, aerobic physical activity</li>
										<li>a combination of the two types of exercise</li>
									</ul> 
									<p>Toward these goals, it is worth remembering that even 10-minute bursts of physical activity during the day provide health benefits.</p>
